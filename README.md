# Motion-Activated-WildLife-Recording-Camera

Motion Activated Wildlife Recording Cameras are intended to be mounted in the wild, hidden from view if necessary, where they can be set to capture still images at specific intervals or video when they detect motion. The cameras can be left in place for months with the hopes of capturing some unique images. Many rare creatures have been documented using wildlife cameras.

Through this project, an initiative has been taken to make one such camera using a Raspberry pi , a USB webcam ,a PIR motion sensor, a handful of other parts and couple of Python programs . This camera will record short videos when some sort of motion is detected by the sensor.

Further we have also suggested some improvements which could have been done if there were no budget and time constraints.
